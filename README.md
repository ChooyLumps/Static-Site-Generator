# Static-Site-Generator
Guided Project on creating a Static Site Generator
---
To see an example output, go to this project's Git Pages page [here](https://chooylumps.github.io/Static-Site-Generator).

## How to Use with Git Pages
---
1. Duplicate this project to your own GitHub profile
2. Delete the **contents** of the static, static/images, and content directories
3. Add your images to the static/images directory
4. Add your CSS doc to the static directory
5. Organize your pages as a series of nested directories inside of the content directory with the home page being at the root of the content directory (see original for example)
6. In each directory, have the page's markdown content in the form of a markdown file named "Index.md"
7. Make sure the repository name in build.sh is correct, then run it
8. Make sure all of your docs are committed and pushed
9. Go into the project's settings/pages and deploy from a branch
10. Set the Branch to main and the file to /docs then hit save
11. The top of the page should now say your site is live and provide you the URL to view your site
